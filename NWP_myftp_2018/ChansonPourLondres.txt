"ChansonPourLondres"

Paroles:

Verse1:

He said, we have got the time... sooooo
Don't worry about the train to London

She knews there's something going wrong
And then she started to worries...
about the train to London..

Refrain:

She never knew how could you fall in love
/* peta un bus ! */
She told me to write a Song About London

Verse2:

Tell me about the night we met before
and the... long story.. about you at London

This song is repeating enought but
don't worry next time, it will be us to London

SingForLondon
