```

### Installing

You need to install all depencies and run "make re" to compile all projet

```
USAGE: ./arcade ./lib/lib_arcade_XXX.so

```
Libs are:

* lib_arcade_SDL.so
* lib_arcade_SFML.so
* lib_arcade_Ncurses.so


```
You can switch between libs by typing "Shift + 1" for previous lib or
"Shift + 2" for next libs.
Same think for games by using "Shift + 3" or "Shift 4"
